# TODO

- [X] create a data accumulator that gets the data from github
- [X] create a generic regression agent class
- [X] create sklearn implementation of the regression agent class
- [X] add documentation to everything
- [X] figure out a second algorithm we can do
- [ ] create slides for Friday's presentation
- [ ] look into combining features if they're potentially dependent
- [ ] training -> holdout( run a bunch of feature combos and pick the best one) -> validating
- [ ] Some kind of user interface that allows them to set variables and data sets
- [ ] Update project memo

## Assignments
### *Andrew:*

- [ ] implement a homebrewed algorithm to replace the sklearn agent
- [ ] add prediction functionality using the variable weights returned by our regression agents
    - the prediction function should take in variable values and returns an estimate for the dependent variable
- [ ] create a function that gets all the coefficients for each state over an interval and compares them
- [ ] potentially use covid prevention measures for each state?
    - look into discrete variable
        
### *Mahin:*
- [ ] Create a neural network reg. implementation
- [ ] find an easy and clean dataset to prove our methods work
- [ ] Some kind of user interface that allows them to set variables and data sets
