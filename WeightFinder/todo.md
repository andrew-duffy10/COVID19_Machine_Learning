- [X] create a generic regression agent class
- [X] create sklearn implementation of the regression agent class
- [X] add documentation to everything
- [ ] figure out a second algorithm we can do
    - potentially use covid prevention measures for each state?
- [ ] create slides for Friday's presentation
    
    
## Assignments
### *Andrew:*

- [ ] implement a homebrewed algorithm to replace the sklearn agent
- [ ] add prediction functionality using the variable weights returned by our regression agents
    - the prediction function should take in variable values and returns an estimate for the dependent variable
- [ ] create a function that gets all the coefficients for each state over an interval and compares them
